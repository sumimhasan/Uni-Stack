# UniStack

**UniStack** is a modern architectural pattern for building scalable, maintainable applications. It improves upon traditional MVC by offering a truly modular, intuitive structure designed for large-scale projects.

---

## Why UniStack?

Traditional MVC often struggles with complexity at scale:

- **Superficial modularity** — Folders based on roles (Model, View, Controller) mix unrelated logic.
- **Complex flow** — Dependency management becomes messy as projects grow.
- **Poor scalability** — Tight coupling and tangled code hinder growth.

**UniStack** addresses these issues with a **modular, flexible, and clean architecture** that evolves with your application.

---

## Key Advantages

- **True modularity** — Features are self-contained and independently manageable.
- **Simplified architecture** — Clear boundaries without over-layering.
- **Built for scale** — Easily grows with your project.
- **Maintainable codebase** — Easier to read, test, and extend.

---

## Getting Started

UniStack is framework-agnostic and works with any language or toolset.

1. Organize code by **feature**, not by role (e.g., models or controllers).
2. Encapsulate logic, data, and UI within each feature module.
3. Handle shared concerns via utilities or middleware.
4. Use consistent, descriptive naming.
5. Keep your code **DRY**, readable, and testable.

## UniStack vs. MVC

| Feature         | MVC                        | UniStack                 |
|----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Modularity      | Shallow                    | Deep and self-contained  |
| Scalability     | Limited                    | Designed for growth      |
| Simplicity      | Often convoluted           | Clean and intuitive      |
| Maintainability | Declines with size         | Easy to maintain         |
